# 🌍 Habitable Exoplanet Data Analysis

This project explores the habitability of confirmed exoplanets using data from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). With over 5,800 planets in the dataset, I built a structured analysis pipeline to filter out candidates based on habitability models and key planetary and stellar features.

After going through the data, only **21 exoplanets** matched the criteria for potential habitability, meaning they are rocky, lie within the habitable zone of their stars, and have an Earth Similarity Index (ESI) of **0.8 or higher**.

## Key Results

- From 5,869 confirmed exoplanets, **5278** matched the stellar criteria.
- **2445** were rocky planets.
- **62** had orbits within the habitable zone.
- Only **21 planets** had an ESI ≥ 0.8.
